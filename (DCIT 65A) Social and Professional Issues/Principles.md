## Principle 1: Public
Software engineers shall <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">act consistently with the public interest</mark>. Software engineers shall, as appropriate:

1. Accept <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">fully responsibility</mark> for their <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">own work</mark>.
2. Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client, and the users with the public good.
3. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief</mark> that is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy, or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be for the public good.  
4. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents.
5. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Cooperate in the efforts to address</mark> matters of grave public concern caused by software, its installation, maintenance, support, or documentation.
6. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Be fair and avoid deception in all statements</mark>, particularly public ones, concerning software or related documents, methods, and tolls.
7. Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and other factors that can diminish access to the benefits of software.
8. Be encouraged to volunteer professional skills for good causes and contribute to public education concerning discipline.

>Explanation:
>1. Your work is really your own, you own the success, the hiccups, and the failure of it.
>2. Always put public good on interest to moderate peers, employer, and users.
>3. Approve you software only if it is safe in all matters and to the best ability that you can. Of course there are some hiccups, with that said having known that you are publishing your software to be consume by the public will motivate you to have it the safest as possible and held other engineers accountable too. In order to have the software deemed safe, secure, and less bugs on the approval stage.
>4. If you think someone's not putting their good cause and doing malevolent acts. Put them behind bars.
>5. In the glimpse of issues in the software, cooperation if the key to address it.
>6. Avoid deception and word manipulation at all cost, especially on related documents (because it is easy to hide deceptive policies there).
>7. With regards to folks who have physical and mental disabilities, there's a need to adjust the software to accommodate them but that is hard since that will eat a lot of development time and testing.
>8. Basically volunteer your knowledge to open source software and other fields like education for the sake of good.

>Explanation: (Self)
>1. Being a software engineer is a lifelong learning and you need to update what's the knowledge in this area since the technology we're working always evolve in some manner.
>2. Connected to the first part but improve the practical area application of the practice within the reasonable time and cost.
>3. Documentation is outright important in this field that's why the improvement in this area is crucial to convey the right, transparent, and utmost understandable case while being concise and truthful.
>4. As you improve the general parts of the field, you also need to take a look at what you are working with: the software and related documents in your environment of work to improve upon.
