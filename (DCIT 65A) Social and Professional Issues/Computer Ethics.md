### What is Computer Ethics?
It is a new branch of ethics that is growing and changing rapidly as computer technology also grows and develops. The term “computer ethics” is open to interpretations both broad and narrow.
- Computer ethics deals with practical problems and focuses on the nature of moral action and responsibility: 
	- How do I know whether an action is morally right or wrong?

### Problem in Computer ethics
A typical problem in Computer Ethics arises because there is a policy vacuum about how computer technology should be used. A central task of Computer ethics is to determine what we should do in such cases, that is, formulate policies to guide our actions. What is needed in such cases is an analysis that provides a coherent conceptual framework within which to formulate a policy for actions. (Moor 1985, p. 266).

Figure 1.0 Moor makes the case that characteristics of computer-based technologies are such that they raise ethical issues that are somewhat unique. Others have suggested that computers are no different from any other branch of professional ethics

## Logical Malleability
Computers can be shaped and molded to perform any activity that can be characterized in terms of inputs, outputs and connecting logical operations. This is in contrast to most manufactured products.

Logic computers, however, can be shaped in finite ways through changes in hardware and software and in terms of their usage. This enables computer-based technologies to exhibit tremendous flexibility.


## Impact to Society
The extensive impact of computerization on society is clear. Naturally, in 1985, when Moor wrote his paper, relatively few could foresee the extent of that impact, nor did anyone envisage the Internet and the World Wide Web. Moor did, however, foresee the changing workplace, and the nature of work:
- Computers have been used for years by businesses to expedite routine work, such as calculating payrolls. However, as personal computers become widespread and allow executives to work at home, as robots do more and more factory work, the emerging question will not be merely How well do computers help us work? But What is the nature of this work?

## Invisibility Factor
1. **Invisible Abuse**: Moor describes this as: “the international use of the invisible operations of a computer to engage in unethical conduct”.
2. **Invisible Programming Values**:  these are values which, according to Moor, are embedded into a computer program.
3. **Invisible Complex Calculation**:  in this context, Moor writes: 
	- Computers today can make enormous calculations beyond human comprehension. Even if a program is understood, it does not follow that the respective calculations are understood. Computers today perform… calculations which are too complex for human inspection and understanding. 
	- He argues that the issue is how much we should trust computer’s invisible calculation. This becomes a significant issue as the consequences grow in importance.
	> This I think if more prevalent to the emergence of AI and its more basic child, machine learning since the machine is the only one really creating the puzzling of the conditions that even human can't really understand now.
	> This is also common to big and complex system software.
