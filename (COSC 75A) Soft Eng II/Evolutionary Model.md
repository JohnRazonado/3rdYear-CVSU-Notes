Also called **Successive versions model** or **Incremental model**. It's a simple model at first but subsequently undergoes functional improvements, adding new functions till the desired system is built.

## Applications 
- Large projects that easily find modules for incremental implementation. Often used when customer wants to start using the core features.
- Also used in object oriented software development because the system can be portioned in units called *objects*.
## Advantages:
- User gets a chance to experiment partially developed system.
- Reduce error because core modules get tested thoroughly. 
## Disadvantages:
- It is difficult to divide the problem into several versions that would be acceptable to the customer which can be incrementally implemented & delivered.
