Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.[1] This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.

software, instructions that tell a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system. The term was coined to differentiate these instructions from hardware—i.e., the physical components of a computer system. A set of instructions that directs a computer’s hardware to perform a task is called a program, or software program.

The two main types of software are system software and application software. System software controls a computer’s internal functioning, chiefly through an operating system, and also controls such peripherals as monitors, printers, and storage devices. Application software, by contrast, directs the computer to execute commands given by the user and may be said to include any program that processes data for a user. 


## Definition of Emerging Technologies
>From [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733315001031)

Emerging technologies have been the subject of much debate in academic research and a central topic in policy discussions and initiatives. Evidence of the increasing attention being paid to the phenomenon of emerging technologies can be found in the growing number of publications dealing with the topic and news articles mentioning emerging technologies (in their headlines or lead paragraphs), as depicted in Fig. 1. Increasing policy interest in emerging technologies, however, must be set against a literature where no consensus has emerged as to what qualifies a technology to be emergent. Definitions proposed by a number of studies overlap, but also point to different characteristics. For example, certain definitions emphasise the potential impact emerging technologies are capable of exerting on the economy and society (e.g. Porter et al., 2002), especially when they are of a more ‘generic’ nature (Martin, 1995), while others give great importance to the uncertainty associated with the emergence process (e.g. Boon and Moors, 2008) or to the characteristics of novelty and growth (e.g. Small et al., 2014).


As a consequence, operationalisations of emergence tend to differ greatly even between approaches using the same techniques. In addition,the understanding of what is an emerging technology differs across actors: some individuals may conceive a technology to be emergent because they expect impact on the socio-economic system, while others may see the same technology as old and no longer emergent. This, in turn, has significant implications for policy making and the governance of emerging technologies.

We identified five attributes of emerging technologies: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity, and defined emerging technologies as: “a relatively fast growing and radically novel technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and the patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous”.

To start, consider the area where emerging technology holds little meaning: tactical IT operations. As an overarching concept, “emerging technology” is not a tactical undertaking. It does not describe a discrete function or goal, in the way that other categories such as “communications platform” or “customer service process” might do. There are individual technologies that companies may be implementing or exploring, but then the focus turns to the necessary details (e.g. IoT sensor integration or AI-enhanced process modification).


>From [Figshare](https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/What_is_an_emerging_technology_/23420075) originally from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies)

 Yet as an area of study, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a consensus on what classifies a technology as ’emergent’ and strong research designs that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper aims to fill this gap by developing a definition of ’emerging technologies’ and linking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by combining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of ’emergence’ with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional issues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five attributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i) radical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising emerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed attributes.

## Brief Answer

### Definition of Software

Is a program that has specific solution of an application. Generally a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. Compromising of entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of computer system. It is coined to differentiate these instructions from hardware (which is the physical components of a computer system). There are two main types of software: System software (controls internal functions) and Application Software (executes command directly given by user or other program).

### Definition of Emerging Technologies
> conclusion on Science Direct

**Final part**
A relatively fast growing and radically novel technology having certain degree of coherence persisting over time.Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous. It is identified with this five attributes: radical novelty, relative fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, uncertainty and ambiguity. It has become a catch-all descriptor for the futuristic advances that will drive the next wave of innovation. The potential impact emerging technologies are capable of exerting on the economy and society.
