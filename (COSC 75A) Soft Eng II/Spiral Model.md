- Diagrammatic representation appears like spiral w/ many loops.
- Exact number of loops in the spiral *is not fixed*.
- Each loop in the spiral represent phase of software process
	- Innermost loop might be on feasibility study
	- Next loop is with requirements specification
	- The next would be design, and so on.

### Phases
### First Quadrant (Objective Setting)
- Needed to identify the objectives of the phase.
- Examine the risks associated with these objectives.

### Second Quadrant (Risk Assessment and Reduction)
- A detailed analysis is carried out for each identified project risk.
- Steps are taken to reduce the risks. For example, if there is a risk that the requirements are inappropriate, a prototype system may be developed.
### Third Quadrant (Development and Validation)
- Develop and validate the next level of the product after resolving identified risks.
### Fourth Quadrant (Review and Planning)
- Review the results achieved so far with the customer and plan
- Progressively more complete version of the software gets built with each iteration around the spiral.
## Circumstance to use Spiral Model

- The spiral model is called *meta model* since it encompasses all other life cycle models.
- Risk handling is inherently built into it, suitable for development of technically challenging software products that are prone to several kinds of risks. 
- However, this model is much more complex than the other models â€“ this is probably a factor deterring its use in ordinary projects.
