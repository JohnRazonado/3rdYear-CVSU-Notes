How we deal with the system. 
- We build system because we adapt to new system.
	- Build to know the need/configuration
	- New market condition must be adapt to the system.

## Background
- Concerned with **Managing Evolving Systems**
- It can be changed as **new versions** of software systems are created
- Involves in development of procedures manage product evolution
- Review general quality management process
	- We can see what can be change
	- Can update the process/procedure, management, evolve system.
- [[Configuration Management Standards|Have standard w/in organization]]

> Note: Be judgmental of the system.
