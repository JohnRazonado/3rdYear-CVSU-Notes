> #inProgress 

### Overview
- It encompasses inventive breakthroughs and progressions 
- These innovations stem from state-of-the-art research and present fresh prospects for various sectors, economies, and communities.

### Objectives
- Primary goal in this lesson is to provide comprehensive understanding.
- Lesson is aimed to acquaint the diverse fields where emerging technologies applied and correlation w/ four distinct phases of industrial evolution.

## Characteristics of Emerging Technologies

1. **Radical Novelty**
	- Pertains to level of originality or innovation present in concept, idea, product or process.
	- Substantial departure from established norms.
2. **Relatively Fast Growth**
	- Pace of progress or expansion exceeds established or traditional patterns.
3. **Coherence**
	- Logical and harmonious connection between different elements or ideas.
	-  Signifies that various components or aspects of a project or idea align seamlessly.
4. **Prominent Impact**
	- Degree to which specific innovation, alteration, or development influences.
	- Substantial and readily observable effect on society.
5. **Ambiguity and Uncertainty**
	- Absence of clarity or predictability in a given situation.
	- Arise from unknown outcomes of a new idea or technology, uncertainty regarding its reception.


## Emerging Technologies Areas

	   - Advancement like spinning jenny, water frame, and steam engine
   - Transition from manual labor to machinery 
2. **Second Industrial Revolution**
	- More extensive mechanization and introduction of new industries like
		- Steel production
		- Electrical power generation
		- Expansion of railway system
3. **Third Industrial Revolution**
	- Defined by extensive embrace of digital technology, along w/ evolution of electronics, computers, and the Internet.
	- Prevalence of personal computers, emergence of WWW, and rapid expansion of IT serves as illustrations of this period.
4. **Fourth Industrial Revolution**
	- Merging of digital technologies, artificial intelligence, the IoT, and various other emerging technologies
	- Convergence leads to substantial transformations across industries, economies, and societies worldwide.
