## Prototype
Toy implementation of the system. Exhibits limited functional capabilities, low reliability, and inefficient performance compared to actual software.
- Built using several shortcuts
- Turns out to be very crude version of actual system.

## Need for Prototype in Software Development

There are several uses of prototype. Important purpose is to illustrate input data formats, messages, reports, and the interactive dialogues to the customer.
- how the screens might look like
- how the user interface would behave
- how the system would produce outputs

Prototype of actual product is preferred in situations such as:
- User requirements not complete
- Technical issues are not clear
