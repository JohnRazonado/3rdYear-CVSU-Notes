## Professional Code of Ethics
is a set of guidelines which are designed to set out acceptable behavior of members of a particular group, association, or profession.

It states the principles and core values that are essential to the work of a particular occupational group. Most codes of ethics created by professional organizations have two main parts: (a) outlines what the organizations aspires to become, and (b) typically lists rules and principles by which members of the organization are expected to abide by.  Many codes also include a commitment to continuing education for those who practice the profession.

Laws do  and not provide a complete guide to ethical behavior.  Just because an activity is not defined as illegal does not mean it is ethical.  However, following a professional code of ethics can produce many benefits for the individual, the profession and society as a whole:
	1.  **Ethical Decision Making:** adherence to professional code of ethics means that practitioners use a common set of core values and beliefs as a guideline for ethical decision making.
	2.  **High Standards of Practice and Ethical Behavior:** adherence to a code of ethics reminds professionals of the responsibilities and duties that they may be tempted to compromise to meet the pressure of day-to-day business.
	3. **Trust and Respect from the General Public:**  public trust is built on the expectation that a professional will behave ethically.
	4.  **Evaluation Benchmark:** a code of ethics provides an evaluation benchmark that a professional can use as a means of self-assessment.
