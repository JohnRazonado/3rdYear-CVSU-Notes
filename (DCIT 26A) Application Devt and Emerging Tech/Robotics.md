#inProgress 

- Combination of engineering, science and technology that produce a machine called "robot".
- A domain where people work with the development and use of robots.
- Mainly deals with the design construction and operation of a robot.
- Machine that's programmed to perform given tasks and gather information from its surroundings.

### Why?
- The purpose of robotics is to automate operations that human do and replace them w/ machines, having better accuracy.


## Laws of Robotics

### Law 1
Robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow human being to come to harm.

### Law 2
Robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

### Law 3
Robot must protect its own existence as long as much protection does not conflict with the first law.


## Types of Robots
### Industrial Robots
- Various works such as Welding, material Handling, Improving Productivity, Inspection are carried out by robots.
### Mobile Robots
- Move around legs, tracks or wheels. There are types of robots that can even handle radio active material.
### Educational Robots
- Used in education. They are abled to bring schools to students who cannot be able to present Physically

### Domestic Robots
- There are two types:
	- Perform household tasks
	- Modern toy that performs tasks like talking, walking, and more.

## Components of Robots
### Manipulator
- arm of the robot
-  It resemble the human hand. It has several joints and links.

### End Effectors
- Used by robots to interact with the environment. They vary according to the task given to the robot. 
- It performs the tasks that are performed by palm and fingers of human hand
### Sensors
- used to gather information from the surroundings.
- These information's are used to guide the robotics behaviour.
### Actuator
- Small motor inside the body of a robot
- Moves in reaction to feedback from sensors
### Controller
- rain of a robot.
- Both the hardware and software are the controllers of the robot. 
- Controls movement of manipulator and end effector.
### Power Supply
- main source of power supply for robots are batteries and photovoltaic cells. Lead acid and silver cadmium batteries are preferred.
## Advantage of Robotics
- No human intervention
- Faster, precise and accurate
- can work 24/7, increases productivitiy
- Can perform multitasking. Manpower gets reduced.
- Work on dangerous tasks, risk of human health and safety is reduced.
- Minimal risk if any failure occurs.
## Disadvantage of Robotics
- Replacing human beings in many places which leads to widespread unemployment
- Costly to built
- Lack of emotions and conscience
- The don't have on the spot decision making capability, they act only as they programmed.

## Future Prospects of Robotics
- Many industries started uses robotic technology
	- Automotive
	- Defence
	- Pharmaceuticals
	- Textiles
	- Atomic Energy
- In the future, robot may look, feel and act like humans.
