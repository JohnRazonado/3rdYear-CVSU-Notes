## Introduction to Software Engineering
It is composed of two words:
#### Software
- More than just a program code. 
- Collection of executable programming code, associated w/ libraries and documentations.
- Made for specific requirement called **software product**
#### Engineering
- All about developing products
- Using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.

### Software Engineering
- engineering branch associated with development of software product.
- Using defined scientific principles, methods and procedures.

### IEEE definition
"application of systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software."

- Alternatively view it as systematic collection of past experience.
- Experience arranged from methodologies and guidelines



### Techniques to reduce complexity
Usually needed to develop large programs to accommodate multiple functions. Having necessary to achieve good quality software cost effectively.

Developing large commercial programs is the complexity and difficulty along with it. Here are some techniques to reduce complexity:

#### Abstraction
- A problem can be simplified by omitting irrelevant details
- consider only those aspects of the problem that are relevant for certain purpose and suppress other aspects that are not relevant for the given purpose.
- simpler problem is solved, then the omitted details can be taken into consideration to solve the next lower level abstraction, and so on


#### Decomposition
- Complex problems is divided into several smaller problems
- Smaller problems solved one by one.
- problem has to be decomposed such that each component of the decomposed problem can be solved independently and then the solution of the different components can be combined to get the full solution.
- Good decomposition of a problem should minimize interactions among various components.

## Need of Software Engineering
- Higher rate of change in user requirements and environment.
#### Large software
- Easier to build a wall than to as house or building, likewise, as size of software become large engineering has to give a scientific process. 
#### Scalability
- It software process were not based on scientific and engineering concepts, it would be easier to re-create one than to scale an existing one.
#### Cost
- skills and manufacturing process lower down the price of computer and electronics hardware. But cost of software remains high if proper process isn't adapted.
#### Dynamic Nature
- Software hugely depends upon environment which user works
- If nature of software always changing, new enhancement need to be done in the existing one.
#### Quality Management
- Better process in software development provides better and quality software product.


### Characteristics of Good Software
Software product can be judge by what it offers and well can it be used.
- Operational
- Transitional
- Maintenance
#### Operational
 Tells how well software works in operation. Measured on:
- Budget
- Usability
- Efficiency
- Correctness
- Functionality
- Dependability
- Security
- Safety

#### Transitional
Important when software is move from one platform to another.

- Portability
- Interoperability
- Reusability
- Adaptability

#### Maintenance
How well software has capabilities to maintain itself in ever-changing environment.

- Modularity
- Maintainabilty
- Flexibilty
- Scalability

> In short, Software engineering is branch of computer science, which uses well-defined engineering concepts required to produce efficient, durable, scalable, in-budget and on-time software products.
