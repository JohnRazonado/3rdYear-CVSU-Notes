## Software
- Considered to be a collection of executable programming code, associated libraries and documentation.

libraries - other codes outside of what you are programming

Documentation - blueprint of a software

### Classes of Software
- **System Software** - Helps run computer hardware and computer itself. Includes OS, device drivers, diagnostic tools and more
- **Application Software** - Allows user accomplish one or more tasks. 
	- Word processing, web browsing, and any other tasks for which might install software
- **Programming Software** - Set of tools aid developers in writing programs.
	- Like compilers, linkers, debuggers, interpreters and text editors.

### [[Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)|(System Development Life Cycle) SDLC]]

> This model could be related to the Classical waterfall model or the iterative version. 

#### Laws in Software Evolution
>https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/papers/2013/lehmanPaper.pdf

##### Continuing Change
- Software systems must continue to adapt to real world changes
##### Increasing complexity
- As software system evolves, complexity increases unless work is done to reduce it.
##### Conservation of Familiarity
- It is how it was develop at a particular manner
- Must be retained at any cost
##### Continuing Growth
- Size implementation grows to the lifestyles changes of the business
##### Reducing Quality
- Software system declines quality unless rigorously maintained and adapted
##### Feedback System
- Systems constitute multi-loop, multi-level feedback system 
- must  be treated as such to be successfully modified or improved.
##### Self-Regulation
- a system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal.
##### Organizational Stability
- evolving a system is invariant over the lifetime of the product.
>The average effective global activity rate in an evolving a system is invariant over the lifetime of the product.

## Methodologies

Specific procedures or techniques used to identify, select, process, and analyze information about a topic.

### Types of Methodologies
- Agile Methodology
	- Commonly used in the industry.
- [[Classical Waterfall Model|Waterfall Model]]
- [[Spiral Model|Spiral Methodology]]
- [[Iterative Waterfall Model|Iterative]]
- V-Model
- [[Prototyping Model|Prototyping]]
