#inProgress 

- Combination of engineering, science and technology that produce a machine called "robot".
- A domain where people work with the development and use of robots.
- Mainly deals with the design construction and operation of a robot.
- Machine that's programmed to perform given tasks and gather information from its surroundings.

### Why?
- The purpose of robotics is to automate operations that human do and replace them w/ machines, having better accuracy.


## Laws of Robotics

### Law 1
Robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow human being to come to harm.

### Law 2
Robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.

### Law 3
Robot must protect its own existence as long as much protection does not conflict with the first law.


## Types of Robots
### Industrial Robots

### Mobile Robots

### Educational Robots

### Domestic Robots

## Components of Robots
### Manipulator

### End Effectors

### Sensors

### Actuator

### Controller

### Power Supply

## Advantage of Robotics
- No human intervention
- Faster, precise and accurate
- can work 24/7, increases productivitiy
- Can perform multitasking. Manpower gets reduced.
- Work on dangerous tasks, risk of human health and safety is reduced.
- Minimal risk if any failure occurs.


## Disadvantage of Robotics
- Replacing human beings in many places which leads to widespread unemployment
- Costly to built
- Lack of emotions and conscience
- The don't have on the spot decision making capability, they act only as they programmed.

## Future Prospects of Robotics
- Many industries started uses robotic technology
	- Automotive
	- Defence
	- Pharmaceuticals
	- Textiles
	- Atomic Energy
- In the future, robot may look, feel and act like humans.
