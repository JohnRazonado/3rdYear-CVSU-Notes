# Operating System
- Intermediary of user to the hardware of computer
- Manager of the hardware
- Judger
- Middle man between the user and the hardware.

##### According to SilverShatz Galvin

##### According to Lister
OS performs
- **Virtual Machine**
	- Hides the complex instructions
- **Resource Manager**
	- **Space Multiplexing**
		- Simultaneous allocation of space
	- **Time Multiplexing**
		- Each process are given a time to process.
		- Manage time of processing


## Component of OS

### Device Manager
- Managing of peripheral devices (Mouse, monitor, printer, etc.)
### Memory Manager

## Evolution of Operating Systems


## Types of OS


## Computer Systems Structure
How really OS loads

1. Bootstrap execution when powers on
2. Bootstrap detects OS
3. Load OS in Main Memory (RAM)
4. Give controls to OS

## Traps and Interrupts
### Traps
restraining of program
1. Indicated abnormal unexplored (unknown if right)
	- Access to invalid or non-existent allocations
2. Access to Restricted memory Allocation
3. Execution of Undefined Code
4. Access to Peripheral Devices

### Interrupts
- Hardware generated event
- Pause process/es until the prioritize process is done.


## Storage Structure

### Consideration of Memory
#### Speed
#### Capacity
#### Price


### Memory Hierarchy
