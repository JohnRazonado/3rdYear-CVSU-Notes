# Operating System
- Without clear understanding of the operating system, learning how the characters or letters typed on the keyboard is transferred to the computer monitor through the SYSTEM UNIT (in layman’s term CPU – which contains various computer parts).
- In addition, a computer fresh from the assembly lines without any installed software is totally worthless and can absolutely accomplished nothing.
- With, the help of operating system, however everything would run perfectly.

- Intermediary of user to the hardware of computer
- Manager of the hardware
- Judger
- Middle man between the user and the hardware.

##### According to SilverShatz Galvin and Gagne (2006)
there are four component of a computer system:

**An operating system may be defined as a computer program that acts interface as an intermediary or between the user of a computer and the computer hardware**

Another similar definition is that it is a set of system software routines that sits between the application programs and the hardware (Davis, Rajkumar, 2001)

#### Function of Operating System
##### According to Lister
OS performs
- **Virtual Machine**
	- Hides the complex instructions
- **Resource Manager**
	- **Space Multiplexing**
		- Simultaneous allocation of space
		- simultaneously allocates free space to all processes that can accommodate
	- **Time Multiplexing**
		- Each process are given a time to process.
		- Manage time of processing
		- **When a resource is time multiplexed it means that each of the different processes are given time to utilize a resource one after the other.**


## Component of OS
### User Command Manager
- provides the human user with a visual tool for communication purpose
### File Manager
- the ability of the user to manipulate, add, edit and delete files named by the user.
### Device Manager
- refers to the OS control over peripheral devices such.
- Managing of peripheral devices (Mouse, monitor, printer, etc.)
### Memory Manager
- focused on proper allocation of memory resources to competing tasks.
### Processor Manager
- Manager  CPU tasks
- managing processor or CPU
- which deals with proper scheduling of tasks in utilizing the processor of CPU.
### Network Manager
- Manage interconnected computer.


## Evolution of Operating Systems
### Zeroth Generation (1940)
### First Generation
### Second Generation
### Third Generation
### Fourth Generation


## Types of OS
### Multi-user OS

### Network/ Distributed OS

### Multiprocessor OS

### Single-User OS

### Real-time OS

### Embedded OS

### Smart Card OS

## Computer Systems Structure
How really OS loads

1. Bootstrap execution when powers on
2. Bootstrap detects OS
3. Load OS in Main Memory (RAM)
4. Give controls to OS

## Traps and Interrupts
Modern operating system are known as being interrupt driven.

A trap is a computer-generated occurrence that results from an error or exception in the programm that is running at the time.
### Traps
Trap is indicative of an abnormal condition sensed by CPU.
1. Access to invalid or non-existent allocations
2. Access to Restricted memory Allocation
3. Execution of Undefined Code
4. Access to Peripheral Devices

### Interrupts
An interrupt, is a hardware-generated event brought on by a timer or an external device (like a keyboard or mouse). It also give a signal sent to the CPU which commonly is in the form of request or message of I/O completion.

- Hardware generated event
- Pause process/es until the prioritize process is done.


## Storage Structure
### Main or Primary Memory
### Secondary Storage

### Memory Hierarchy


### Consideration of Memory
#### Speed
#### Capacity
#### Price
